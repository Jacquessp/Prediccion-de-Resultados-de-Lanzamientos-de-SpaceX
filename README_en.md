# SpaceX Machine Learning Prediction
## General Description
**This project aims to develop predictive models using Machine Learning techniques to analyze historical SpaceX data. The primary goal is to forecast the success of future rocket launches by examining various factors that may influence mission outcomes. The project is divided into multiple parts, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and model building.**

Project Structure
1. Data Collection
Notebook: jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb

Description:
This notebook focuses on collecting SpaceX launch data via the SpaceX API. The dataset includes information on launch dates, outcomes, launch locations, and other relevant details.
The data is processed and cleaned to ensure quality and readiness for further analysis.
2. Data Wrangling
Notebook: labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling (1).ipynb

Description:
In this stage, the collected data is transformed and reshaped to prepare it for analysis. This includes handling missing values, data normalization, and formatting adjustments to optimize the dataset for machine learning applications.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Notebook: jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz.ipynb

Description:
This notebook provides an exploratory analysis of the data, identifying patterns, trends, and key relationships that will guide feature engineering. Various data visualization techniques are used to gain insights into the data.
4. Launch Site Location Analysis
Notebook: lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb

Description:
This notebook focuses on analyzing the geographical locations of launch sites and their impact on launch outcomes. Spatial data is examined to understand the significance of each location in the success or failure of launches.
5. Machine Learning Model Development
Notebook: SpaceX_Machine Learning Prediction_Part_5.ipynb

Description:
